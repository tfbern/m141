# Task manager
This task manager is a fork of the todo-app.
It is adapted to work with a MySQL database. Also the GUI is enhanced. Furthermore a user login has been implemented.
The application consists of two parts, the GUI and the API. For the third part, the database, only the SQL DDL statements are provided in order to setup such a database.

To start the API change to */todo-api/* and run ```nodemon```

To start the GUI change to */todo-gui/* and run ```npm run serve```
